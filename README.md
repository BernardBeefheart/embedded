Here is some code for little devices. Most of it will be for Microchip processors and tested with an _Explorer 16_. There will be dependancies with other repositories of mine.

Today, 10/07/2014, I have an [_ICD 3_](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164035), an [_Explorer 16_](http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=dm240001 Microchip) with three _PIMS_. Unless I tell otherwise, every project is managed under [_MPLAB X_, version 2.05](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/) on a Debian (most recent versions of the IDE don't run well).

If you think my english is not good, you're certainly right, I'm born somewhere else.
